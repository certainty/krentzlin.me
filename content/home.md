## Hi There ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m David Krentzlin and I have a curious interest in how people work, think, feel and ultimately come to terms with their unique set of skills and shortcomings.
I try to understand how we can sustain in this industry, keep learning, face successes and failures and bring forth the best in us without losing ourselves, our humanity or private lives.

If you want to work with me, please check out my [career page](/portfolio/).
